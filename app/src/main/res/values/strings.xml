    <string name="pp">Quotes is a free Android application provided by me, Luca. Quotes does not collect any of your data and it never will. Every interaction with me is free to choose. I offer the possibility to send EMails to suggest features, give feedback and report bugs. As soon as the conversation between me and the user is ended, the feature is implemented (or not) or the bug has been fixed (or can\'t be fixed), I will delete the contact information (Email-Address) and the conversation for security and for privacy reasons.\n\n\nI may change my Privacy Policy from time to time. Every change is effective immediately. An information to the change of this Privacy Policy will be added to the changelog.\n\n\nEffective September 3, 2022</string>
