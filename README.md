# Quotes' alternative design

This application was made to be an alternative build, but now it is the main app.
It uses some new things I learned thanks to the help of Yanndroid.

This application needs to be connected to the internet, since it will parse the quotes, persons and editors choice from the JSON-File on GitHub.

The JSON-File will be changed from time to time. Luckily, you don't need to update the app for the changes, since my code offers the possibility to parse new authors + their quotes by getting the extra out of an intent and setting it into getJSONArray();.
With this it saves me from publishing new versions just to give users new quotes, also I can faster change new quotes, persons, etc., so I have more time to think about features and bugs.
